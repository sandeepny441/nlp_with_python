        Boris Johnson, the prime minister of Britain, on Friday announced that he had tested 
        positive for the coronavirus. 
        In a brief video released on Twitter, he shared the basics: 
        Having developed “mild symptoms — that’s to say, a temperature and a 
        persistent cough” — he underwent testing and received the bad news. 
        He will now be “self-isolating” until the illness has run its course.
